# What is this
This is a snake game üêç implemented in javaScript.
This JavaScript project is not part of any bigger agenda. This is just my attempt to making a snake game with **vanilla javaScript**, no additional libraries used.
I don't usually program games with javaScript so this is a good exercise.
#### *Note
I could make this prettier with textures and sound effects but **the aim of this project** was just to make a working snake game with javaScript.
The index website does not have anything fancy, just the canvas.

#### ‚è±Ô∏èTime used : 2 hours.

# How to use
Snake game inputs contain **Arrow keys** to move and **Space key** to restart.
High score of the session is stored within the script. If page is refreshed, highscore will restart.

# What i learned
I learned to use canvas and its 2d context. Not very much, but enough to make this project succesfull.
I **did not struggle** with anything really. JavaScript syntax is **pretty simple** and **familiar** from other projects.
